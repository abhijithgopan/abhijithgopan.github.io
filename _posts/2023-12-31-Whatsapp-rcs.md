Last month, Apple announced they will support RCS messages on iMessage starting next year. Many people on the internet think that it will end the blue-green bubble saga among iOS and Android users (in the US).

I have a different take here. As an Android user, I know that outside the US, even iPhone users don't care about the iMessage, as everyone uses WhatsApp as their primary messaging app. Yesterday, Google announced they have crossed 1 billion active users with RCS enabled in Google Messages. Also they have announced some interesting features coming to the app like message reactions, custom emojis from photos etc.

I believe Apple's adoption of RCS may not hurt them , but it may hurt WhatsApp. If Apple adopted the RCS and messaging between Android and iPhone users would become seamless it will lead to more people ditching WhatsApp. Meta is adding too many unwanted features to WhatsApp like the channels and moving away from the primary focus as a messaging app. Recently, I am getting a lot of business message spams too.Yeah, simply put, WhatsApp is trying to be the next Telegram.

I love the Chat bubble feature on Android. I will ditch WhatsApp for sure if Apple adopted RCS as Google Messages support chat bubbles which are lacking in WhatsApp. I am not saying Google Messages is a perfect product. If Google can rectify the flaws and focus on adding more features, I hope people may start using it as their primary messenger.

That said everything depends on Google, I really wish Google not killing the RCS and Messages app one fine morning.
