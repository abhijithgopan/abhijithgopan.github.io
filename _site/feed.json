            "content_text": "1. Purusha PrethamKrishand’s Purusha Pretham will undoubtedly take first place on my list. I loved his previous work Aavasavyuham and when he announced Purusha Pretham, my expectations where high.The movie is  experimental in many ways, like the cinematography, story telling,music etc and the makers succeeded in not boring the audience. The performances by Jagadish and Prasanth Alexander were outstanding.2. Kannur SquadMammootty Kampany, the production house by the legendary actor Mammootty, had  only produced two films before this film and their previous productions where well-accepted by the audience.  Their third film, Kannur Squad, which came to cinemas with low hype became a blockbuster at the box-office through word of mouth. Roby Raj’s directorial debut, which is based on Kerala Police’s investigation team Kannur Squad is a well made movie with superb cinematography and background music. I watched the film in theatres and the experience was good.3. IrattaIratta is an investigative thriller  directed by Rohith Krishnan which amused me by its climax. Joju George as an actor gives a terrific performance in this film. The ending is the major positive of the movie. The film didn’t get a long run in the theatres and failed at the box-office is a sad part. This film deserved much more success in the theatre.4. FalimyI loved Falimy, its a simple yet beautiful film with many laughable moments. Jagadish, Basil, Manju Pillai and that Appooppan everyone did a great job in entertaining the audience in this movie.5. PookkaalamGanesh Raj’s Pookkaalam is a small movie which loved for its simplicity. Vijayaraghavan did an amazing performance in this movie. The combo scenes by Basil Joseph and Vineeth Sreenivasan was awesome.",
